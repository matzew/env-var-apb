# Ansible Playbook Bundle for Environment Variable operator

Deploy the [Environment Variable Operator](https://github.com/project-streamzi/EnvironmentVariableOperator) into Openshift using an Ansible Playbook Bundle.

This project is intended to be used in conjunction with the [Ansible Service Broker](https://github.com/project-streamzi/ocp-broker) which allows custom applications to be deployed into Openshift from the Service Catalog.
